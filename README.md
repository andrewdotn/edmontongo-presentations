# Edmonton Go Presentions

This repository contains slides & code for talks given at the [Edmonton Go Meetup](http://edmontongo.org/).

We use the issue tracker to schedule future talks. Share what **you** have learned with the group. You don't need to be an expert to present.

Fork to add your talk under a `yyyy-mm\title` folder.
